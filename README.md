  <h2 align="center">Note-Taker--To-Do-List</h2>

 I spearheaded the development of a robust web application named "Note-Taker" as part of a comprehensive project.
 Leveraging my expertise in Java technologies, I integrated Servlets, JSP, Hibernate, 
 and MySQL to create a dynamic and secure note-taking platform.
